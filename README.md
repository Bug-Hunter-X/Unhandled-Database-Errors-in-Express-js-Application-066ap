# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Application

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling for database operations.  The provided code lacks proper error handling, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior when database queries fail.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that fetches user data from a database.  It does not include robust error handling for cases where the database query fails or returns null. This can result in unhandled exceptions, causing the application to crash or return inconsistent responses.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to improve error handling.  It includes checks for errors during database access and sends appropriate HTTP status codes (500 for server errors, 404 for not found) to the client. This ensures more reliable and user-friendly behavior.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3.  Run the buggy code using `node bug.js` (it requires a mock `db` to work).
4.  Observe the lack of error handling when an error occurs.
5.  Compare its behavior to the solution file by running `node bugSolution.js`
